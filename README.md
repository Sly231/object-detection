# object-detection:
Our solution utilizes Machine Learning, specifically the pre-trained EfficientDet-D4 object detection model from TensorFlow Hub. 
It addresses the challenge of automating object detection in images. Users can load an image, preprocess it, and then use the model to detect objects with high accuracy. 
The main application areas include autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, medical imaging, and content moderation. 
The key components of the solution involve image preprocessing, object detection using the pre-trained model, and post-processing to filter out low-confidence detections. 
The innovation lies in leveraging transfer learning, enabling accurate detection with limited labeled data. TensorFlow Hub simplifies model integration, facilitating rapid prototyping and deployment. 
Overall, our solution provides an efficient and effective way to detect objects in various domains.
